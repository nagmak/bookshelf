# bookshelf
<<<<<<< HEAD
Contains multiple lists: current reads, future reads and the contents of my bookshelf. Feel free to browse and send me a book recommendation via Twitter!

### To do:
1. Improve navbar UI
2. Be able to add books directly via site
3. Checkboxes to indicate when a book has been read, removed from shelf, etc
4. Use a DB instead of directly on HTML
